
/*CSS or (Cascading Style Sheets) is A style sheet language that
allows you to take something such as plain HTML markup
and transform it into a beautiful looking website.*/


/*The browser applies basic styles make the document more readable. */
/*1. Headings will look larger than regular text*/
/*2. Paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them*/
/*3. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text*/


/*Example - CSS Syntax*/
/*CSS is a rule-based language.*/
/*The rule opens with a selector.*/
/*The selector will be the HTML element that we are going to be styling.*/
/*In this case we are styling level one headings (<h1>)*/

/*We then have a set of curly braces*/
/*inside the curly braces we will have one or more declarations*/
/*depending on the styles we want to apply. The declarations consist*/
/*of property and value pairs.*/
h1 {
    /*color is a property*/
    /*red is the value*/
    /*colon and semicolon*/
    color: red; /*can take colors*/
    font-size: 70px; /*can take different units*/
    /*Perfectly fine to look things up*/

/*Again, as I have mentioned before, CSS is a style sheet language*/
/*for specifying how documents are presented to users â€”
 whether it's how they are styled, laid out, animated, and much more.*/
