    <title>Adding CSS to your page</title>
    <!--An external stylesheet is the most common method of adding CSS to your web page.-->
    <!--It is also the most efficient way out of the 3 methods because you can organize-->
    <!--all your styles within a single file that you can then reference within all your web pages-->

    <!--Link to external stylesheet in the head element-->
    
    <!--The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document you're on,
     in this case the HTML document, and the document or resource that you are linking which in this case is the stylesheet-->

    <!--The href attribute of the <link> element needs to reference a file on your file system-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    <!--INTERNAL STYLESHEET-->
    <!--An internal stylesheet are styles that live within an HTML document.
    To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>-->
    <style>
        h1{
            background-color: black;
        }
    </style>
    <!--If you only have 1 page then it doesn't make much of a difference if-->
    <!--you use an internal or external stylesheet. The biggest difference is when-->
    <!--you have multiple pages. Internal stylesheets are not very efficient because-->
    <!--this means that you will have to include the same styles over and over again within-->
    <!--each page. This can be a nightmare when it comes to maintaining your site because-->
    <!--if you wish to make changes, you will have to modify each page as well.-->

    <!--However, an internal stylesheet can be useful in certain situations. For example,-->
    <!--if you're working with a content management system that doesn't let you modify the-->
    <!--external stylesheet, then you can use internal styles to make changes.-->
</head>
<body>
    <!--INLINE STYLES-->
    <!--Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element.-->
    <!--inline styles are placed within a style attribute that you add to an element.-->
    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;padding: 10px;">I'm ready to be styled!</h1>
    <!--Avoid using using inline styles when possible.-->
    <!--It is not a good practice because, again, it's hard to maintain and not-->
    <!--efficient if you have to make changes to multiple pages.-->
    <!--It also makes your HTML markup hard to read.-->

    <!--Inline styles are only useful if you're working in a restrictive environment-->
    <!--such as only being allowed to modify the body of the page.-->
</body>
